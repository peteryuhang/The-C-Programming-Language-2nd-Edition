- **Statement, if-else**
  - In C, the semicolon is a **statement terminator**
  - When there is a nested if sequence, the else will associate with the **closest** previous if
- **Switch**
  - After the code for one case is done, execution **falls through to the next** unless you take explicit action to escape (**break** and **return** are the most common way to leave a switch)
